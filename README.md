Honesltly I jsut do this to create a Streakn Github but i genuinely want to learn writing README.md because it is really important in terms of Software Engineer or a Good Programmer Overall 


Also in this README.md there are many things I needed to explore so this is some sort of like a blog thing

but first I want to explore 

1. how to learn programming And Coding and Software Engineering and Data Engineering and many things like that

2. Computer Science Degree vs Building a projects (I learn from watching a Guy on YouTube that he created various things in terms of game development but the key lies on the Networking and Connection to a school and Company which it make it better for the Future Job Hunting so if you are studying in Computer Science Degree use it as a network and also Simultaneously working in the projects 

3. Prompting AI in coding and stuff like that because I learn that Junior Devs can't code anymore because of AI and stuff like that so I wonder how to really learn stuff properly and how to use AI to do things because Prime Time said that it's really how hard you work toward something so I wonder what should I do or rather how I can Integrate AI and Programming and building something because I really relied on ai back then that I can't code anymore without that AI so I wonder how to use it properly to get something started without deteriorating the skills of programming and coding
