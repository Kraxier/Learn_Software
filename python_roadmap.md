# Step-by-Step Roadmap

## 1. Learn Core Programming/CS Concepts in Some Language

### 1.1 Basics of Programming
- **Syntax & Fundamentals**
  - Variables, Data Types
  - Operators
  - Input/Output

### 1.2 Control Structures
- Conditionals (if, else, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)

### 1.3 Functions & Modularity
- Defining & calling functions
- Parameters & Return values
- Scope (Local vs Global variables)

### 1.4 Data Structures
- Arrays/Lists
- Strings
- Dictionaries (Hash Maps)

### 1.5 Algorithms & Problem Solving
- Time & Space Complexity (Big-O Notation) eg. O(1), O(n), O(n²), O(log n)
- Searching & Sorting
  - Linear Search, Binary Search
  - Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort
- Recursion

### 1.6 Memory Management
- Stack vs Heap

### 1.7 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes & Objects
- Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction

### 1.8 Core CS Concepts
- Operating Systems (Processes, Threads)
- Networking (HTTP, TCP/IP)
- Databases (SQL vs NoSQL)
- Compilers & Interpreters

### 1.9 Practice & Projects
- Solve problems on LeetCode, HackerRank
- Build small projects (Todo App, Calculator, Tic-Tac-Toe)
- Contribute to open source

### 1.10 Additional Learning Source
- **File Handling** (Reading/Writing Files) → Add to "Data Structures"
- **Regular Expressions (Regex)** → Useful for text processing (add under "Advanced Topics")
- **Web Scraping** (BeautifulSoup, Selenium) → Not in my roadmap, but great for automation
- **Working with Excel/PDFs** (openpyxl, PyPDF2) → Practical but niche (add under "Libraries")
- **GUI Automation** (pyautogui) → Fun but not core CS

### Goal: Build a Sudoku Thing
- Learn Python and CS concepts, and practice good pseudocode.

## What is Pseudocode?
Pseudocode is a simplified, human-readable representation of an algorithm that uses a mix of natural language and programming-like syntax. It’s not actual code but serves as a blueprint before writing real code in a specific language (e.g., Python, C++).

### Steps to Write Pseudocode:
1. **Start with the goal**: Clearly state what the algorithm should do.
2. **Use indentation**: Show blocks (like loops/conditionals) for readability.
3. **Be precise but concise**: Avoid unnecessary details.
4. **Use common keywords**:
   - INPUT/OUTPUT for data.
   - FOR, WHILE for loops.
   - IF-ELSE for conditionals.

## Why Use Pseudocode?
- **Clarity**: Focuses on logic without getting bogged down by syntax.
- **Collaboration**: Helps teams discuss algorithms before implementation.
- **Planning**: Acts as a bridge between problem-solving and coding.
